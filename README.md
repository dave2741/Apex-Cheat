## How It Works

Apex Cheat operates by interfacing with the game‚Äôs memory. Here‚Äôs a simplified overview of its components:

- **Aimbot**: The Aimbot tracks enemy positions and automatically adjusts your aim. It uses a combination of memory reading and algorithmic targeting to improve hit accuracy.
  
- **ESP Overlays**: The ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) overlays display enemy locations, health, and loot visibility. It reads game data to provide real-time information.

- **HWID Spoofer**: The HWID Spoofer alters your hardware ID, making it difficult for anti-cheat systems to link your account to any previous bans.
